Our Definition of Done:
For Sprint 0, a feature is considered “done” if it meets the following criteria:

 - Functionality: The feature works as expected without bugs in local tests.
 - Documentation: Each feature includes adequate documentation (comments and commit messages) explaining code and functionality.
 - Peer Review: All code changes are reviewed by at least one other team member on GitHub.
 - Test Coverage: Key functions and components have test cases written and passing in our test suite.
 - User Story Satisfaction: Each feature meets the acceptance criteria outlined in its user story on Trello.
