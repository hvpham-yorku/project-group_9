Google URL: google.com
Bing URL: bing.com

While our search engine will act similar to Google and Bing, we will also be implementing a web scraper in our search engine. Given a URL, it will give a brief summary of the website given or answer a question you have about the website.
Webscraping will allow us to give a better experience for our users. It will allow users to get fast answers from a website they are looking for. If they want general results, they can use our seach engine.
