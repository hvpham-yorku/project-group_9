Coordination of our work was key for sprint 0 and for sprint 1. We split up our work based on what each person could do best and updated each other on key progress as we went along.

We are also discussing together the content of our search engine before we put it in writing. We want to make sure that the whole group agrees on the content and are on the same page. We do not want to add extra stuff that none of us would be able to implement over the course of the project.

For this sprint, there are a couple of deliverables that have to be done together. We worked on it together in a dicord call to make sure everyone can get an input and we can make decisions as a group.

For our next sprint, we are deciding on splitting up the work and making sure that we keep each other updated on our work. We would also like to make sure we have key ideas and points laid out so we know what to implement in our project. We also would like to make sure that we can implement a smoother transition between webpages.
