# Summary

## Project Objective

Design a user-friendly search engine with web-scraping capabilities and AI enhancements. The main goal is to provide information that is accurate, contextually relevant, and simplified. This will empower users to expeditiously find answers relating to their needs.

## Personas

**Druv Patel** – 15 year old Dhruv is a highschool student. He is an inquisitive and curious student who takes his studies seriously. He is involved in extracurricular activities at his school such as debate club and math club. 

Dhruv is very comfortable with technology. He owns a smartphone which he takes to school and a laptop which he uses to work at home. He grew up using devices like an ipad and gaming consoles. He is capable of using computers for a wide variety of reasons.

Dhruv regularly searches the internet for a variety of reasons. Sometimes he'll see something in the world around him that leads him to create a question. He then inputs his question into the search engine in order to get websites and articles relevant to his search query. Another reason is to help aid him with his schoolwork. Sometimes the teacher or the textbook doesn't give a satisfactory or clear enough answer to his questions, so Dhruv uses the search engine to look up the answer to his question.

**John Smith** – John is a 38 year old man who has been married to his wife for 7 years and has 2 children. He has a boy of 5 years and a girl of 2. John has been working as an accountant at a large company since he graduated from university.

John is a veteran accountant with many years of hard work under his belt. He is very familiar with the various software that he uses in his job as well as his working computer. In spite of this John is not as familiar with either smartphones or the internet. Most of John's technological expertise is restricted to his job.

John occasionally searches the web for a few reasons. Sometimes his son will ask him a question he doesn't know the answer to so he'll search up the question and tell his son while pretending that he knows the answer. Additionally sometimes John will search up the latest news articles so that he stays aware of current events.

## Key Scenarios

1. Dhruv needs to prepare for a complex biology project due tomorrow and so he needs to find relevant information quickly and which is clear and reliable.
2. John is searching for a simple explanation of a recent financial news event, needing a clear and digestible summary to stay informed for his work.
3. Dhruv is looking up tutorials for a challenging math problem he encountered during his study session. He's hoping to find a clear, easy to follow tutorial and/or straightforward solution to the problem.

## Key Principles

Relevance, conciseness, and clarity: The design should produce tailored results relevant to the search in a clear and concise manner.

Simplicity: The interface and AI functionalities should be intuitive, enhancing user comfort and ease, regardless of their tech background.
